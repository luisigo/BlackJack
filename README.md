Hello!
This is the README for my blackjack game.

I'm making two versions; one with AI, one without
It's round-based, with a straightforward betting system
Everything functions, so far.

When you run the game(with AI), it'll prompt you to select from two bots, Alan or Mark. Alan is aggressive, while Mark is more conservative.
You then can Hit, H, or Stay, S, playing against the dealer.

Have Fun!
